Grep Routes
===========
Running `rake routes` is super slow and a waste of time. 

`grep_routes` is similar to `rake routes | grep someroute` but way faster. My SuperScientificBenchmarksâ„¢ indicate 10x speed improvement over `rake routes` on big Rails projects to 3x on a fresh Rails 3.2 app, ymmv.

**Note: This only works on Rails 3.1 and 3.2.**

Install
-------

    gem install grep_routes
    
Usage
-----
All commands should be run from the root of your Rails3 project.

Show all your routes:

    grep_routes
    
Grep through your routes:
  
    grep_routes privacy_policy
    
Grep through your routes using regex:

    grep_routes "(privacy_policy|terms|\w+_id)"
